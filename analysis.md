Task 3: Networking Basics for Cyber Security

Tool Used: Wireshark

Observations:
1. Captured live network traffic using Wireshark.
2. Observed DNS queries when opening websites.
3. TCP protocol was used for reliable communication.
4. TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) was observed.
5. HTTP traffic is plain text while HTTPS is encrypted.
6. HTTPS is more secure than HTTP.

Conclusion:
This task helped me understand basic networking and how attackers can analyze network traffic using packet sniffing tools.
